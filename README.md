# travl-localization

Thank you for helping with the translations.

Here is a small guide on how to help translate, if you don't know what to do:

This is the method for directly commiting to the master, you can also create a pull request. that way Meg has to confirm your changes first.

If you do create a new branch (not as a pull request) , dont forget to merge it to the master branch. 

1. clone the repository by using the clone link (you can easily do that with sublime merge or the github desktop version if you dont want to do it in the terminal)
2. copy the en.lproj folder 
3. add it next to the other folders. 
4. rename it to yourLanguageCode.lproj (use https://www.ibabbleon.com/iOS-Language-Codes-ISO-639.html if you don't know the code)
5. edit the strings file and add your localisations
6. Add a commit message and commit & push
