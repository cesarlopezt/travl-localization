# travl-localization

Thank you all for helping with the translationsü§ó

Travll is a digital travel diary created for people who love travelling. You can save trips and recreate moments to take a look back as soon as they open the app. I have build the ‚Äúinstagram-like‚Äù stories feature programmatically,and I have also used MapKit to show the places the user have visited.

Directly commit to the master
Create a pull request, that way I have to confirm your changes first
If you do create a new branch (not as a pull request), dont forget to merge it to the master branch

# Here is a small guide on how to help translate, if you don't know what to:

1. clone the repository by using the clone link (you can easily do that with sublime merge or the github desktop version if you dont want to do it in the terminal)
2. copy the en.lproj folder 
3. add it next to the other folders. 
4. rename it to yourLanguageCode.lproj (use https://www.ibabbleon.com/iOS-Language-Codes-ISO-639.html if you don't know the code)
5. edit the strings file and add your translations
6. add a commit message and commit & push
